# Labyrinth-Data-Algorithm

## Overview

Welcome to Labyrinth-Data-Algorithm, a Python-based project dedicated to helping users navigate and escape from labyrinthine environments. Whether you're trapped in a maze, an intricate building layout, or simply enjoy solving labyrinth puzzles, this tool is here to assist you. The project employs a combination of data structures and algorithms to find the optimal path to freedom.

## Features

- **Labyrinth Representation**: Import labyrinth layouts from various sources, such as text files or manual input, and represent them digitally for analysis.

- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Choose from a selection of pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, or depth-first search to find the shortest route out of the labyrinth.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize the labyrinth and the pathfinding process step by step or in real-time, making it easier to understand and follow.

- **Customization**: Configure the project to accommodate different labyrinth sizes and structures, including 2D and 3D mazes.
